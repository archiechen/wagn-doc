1. Cards

  Not only is all the text on Wagn stored in cards, but images, files, users, settings, and searches are all cards.

1. Editing

  To edit a card, click on its Edit tab, or double-click anywhere in the content of the card.

  Some card types, like Images, Files, Pointers and Dates, have different editors. If you edit an image or file, for example, you'll see a "Browse" button that lets you select a file on your computer

1. Card Types

  Card Types are a powerful tool for organizing information on Wagn. Every card has a type, and that type shapes what kind of information goes into each card. 
    * Basic
    
      Rich text, and it's the default cardtype.  Uses a simple wysiwyg editor.
    * Html
    
      HTML cards let you add in and keep all the HTML you like. 
    * File
    
      On Wagn you upload files to File cards, then include the cards wherever you want a link to the file to appear.
